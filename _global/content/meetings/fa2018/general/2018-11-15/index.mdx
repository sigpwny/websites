## Meeting Summary
- *Threat modeling* is the process of identifying and ranking threats in order to dedicate time and effort accordingly
- *Compartmentalization* is making sure that your accounts are not linked together in order to limit the impact of a compromise of a single one
- *Rotation* is the regular updating of passwords and online personas
- Many experience *security fatigue* as they learn more about security, overwhelming or depressing them from all they need to keep track of
