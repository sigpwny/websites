## Meeting Summary
- TCP Handshake - A TCP connection is started through a three-way handshake of packets: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.
- TCP vs UDP - TCP is reliable and ordered. UDP is less reliable but faster.
- Netcat (aka `nc`) - An incredibly useful command tool for connecting to CTF challenges.
- Wireshark - A GUI tool for analyzing network traffic on a packet level.
