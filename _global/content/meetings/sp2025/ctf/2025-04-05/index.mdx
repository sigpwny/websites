## About
Tracer FIRE is a two-day event from Sandia, teaching students to investigate multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) adversaries in a simulated incident response scenario. Learn cyber forensic techniques and tools to discover:

- Who's the adversary?
- How'd they get in?
- What did they want; did they succeed?
- How to prevent recurring incidents?

Sandia National Laboratories is running Tracer FIRE on April 5th - April 6th from 9am-5pm on Saturday and 9am-3pm on Sunday. The event will be held on campus at UIUC, as well as simultaneously at Purdue and University of Minnesota. Tracer FIRE is an event where you will learn incident response and forensics techniques, then put to a skills challenge! Lunch will be provided during the event and there will be prizes:

- Tracer FIRE Challenge Coin
- Wireless Earbuds
- Tracer FIRE Lanyards

This event is also a time to connect with Sandia employees for the work that they do and possible job opportunities!
