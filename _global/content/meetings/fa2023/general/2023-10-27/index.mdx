## Summary

We will be hosting a workshop with Caesar Creek Software! Two engineers from Caesar Creek Software, Luke Giannoutsos and Luke Burnett, will be at our workshop. They will share what it’s like to work as Software Engineers in a Cybersecurity company. They will also have an exciting demo of one of past intern projects to share. Pizza will be provided!
