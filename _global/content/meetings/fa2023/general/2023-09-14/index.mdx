## Summary

Come to our second web hacking meeting to learn how to break websites on the server-side! We will be covering what happens when a client sends malicious input, causing the server to behave unexpectedly, specifically SQL injection (SQLi) and cross-site scripting (XSS)!

We also will be inviting one of our Fall CTF 2023 sponsors, Battelle, to speak about their cybersecurity careers, internships, and opportunities!
