Tracer FIRE has students investigate multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) adversaries in a
simulated incident response scenario. Cyber forensic techniques/tools developed by Sandia are used to discover:

* Who’s the adversary?
* How’d they get in?
* What did they want; did they succeed?
* How to prevent recurring incidents?

The event will be in person in the **[Natural History Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rz9CTqHc6DrECHDW9)** Room 2020, on Saturday, March 23 from 9am-5pm and Sunday, March 24 from 9am-3pm. There will be a Sandia National Laboratory overview and Q&A on Friday March 22 from 6:30-8pm in Siebel 1404.
