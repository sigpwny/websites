## Summary

Come learn about the technology that runs the web, how it works, and how to manipulate it! We'll cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, plus an intro to how HTTP servers actually transmit this data via requests and responses. You'll also learn about the devtools feature in most browsers, which allows you to observe the functions of websites.
