## Summary
We will be teaching the art of lockpicking through hands-on activities! We will provide locks and lockpicks, but feel free to bring your own! We highly recommend coming to this meeting in-person.

### Important
Do not apply any of the skills you may learn in our lockpicking meetings to real locks without explicit permission. We are providing this meeting for educational purposes and will not be responsible for anything you may do.
