## Summary

We will discuss reverse engineering for compiled binaries! We will show how to "decompile" an x86 binary into readable code using Ghidra and then "step" through the program using GDB.

Before this meeting, we highly recommend setting up your laptop with tools for reversing (especially ghidra and gdb) and reviewing the x86-64 meeting.
