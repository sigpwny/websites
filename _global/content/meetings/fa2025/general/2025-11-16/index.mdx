## Summary
Learn about the overlap between computer architecture and security! We will be discussing various CPU vulnerabilities and the optimizations and features that lead to those vulnerabilities. We will have some hands-on exercises and experiments in addition to our discussion. If you would like, make an account on EDA Playground prior to the meeting. If you aren't able to, don't worry - we will be allotting time during the meeting to do this.
