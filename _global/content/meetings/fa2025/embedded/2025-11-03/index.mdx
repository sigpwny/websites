We highly recommend that you review the [Side-Channel Attacks](/meetings/embedded/2025-10-27/) meeting before this meeting! We will be getting hands-on with the ChipWhisperer Nano!

## Learning Objectives
- Explain what fault injection attacks are
- Explain how a voltage glitching/crowbar attack works
- Understand how a ChipWhisperer is used to pull off attacks
- Explain terminology related to glitch attacks
  - Triggers
    - Basic
    - Edge Counter, ADC (CW-Husky)
    - UART (CW-Husky)
    - SAD, or Sum of Absolute Differences (CW-Husky)
  - Glitch parameters
    - `ext_offset`
    - `repeat`
    - `offset`
    - `width`
