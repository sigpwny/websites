## Learning Objectives

**Explain fundamental electrical principles**
  - Describe the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance (Ohmâ€™s Law).
  - Identify the function and behavior of resistors and capacitors in simple circuits.

**Explain different hardware tools and their use-cases**
  - Oscilloscope
  - Logic analyzer
  - Multimeter
  - Power supply
  - ChipWhisperer

**Interpret documentation and datasheets**
  - Locate pinouts, voltage ranges, and timing diagrams in a datasheet.
  - Apply datasheet information to correctly wire and test a component on a breadboard.

**Assemble and test breadboard circuits**
  - Build simple circuits on a breadboard from a schematic.
  - Select and use resistors/capacitors appropriately for tasks such as current limiting and filtering.
  - Verify circuit functionality through measurement and debugging with tools.
