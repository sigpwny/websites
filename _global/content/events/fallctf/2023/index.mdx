## Rules
1. No sharing flags or solutions.

4. Teams are limited to two players each.
5. Unless specified otherwise, the flag format is `sigpwny{*}`.

## Divisions
The competition is divided into a Beginner and Advanced division to fairly distribute prizes. There are no differences in challenges or challenge difficulty between divisionsâ€”all challenges are designed to be approached by beginners. 

If one team member meets the requirements for the Advanced division, the entire team must compete under the Advanced division.

### Beginner Division
The beginner division is intended for underclassmen students who do not have much experience with CTFs, cybersecurity, or even computer science! We require teams with experience to compete in the Advanced division instead.

### Advanced Division
If either you or your teammate have taken CS 341 (previously CS 241), ECE 391, or have played in three or more CTFs, then your team should be registered in the Advanced division. If you have some experience or would like to compete in the Advanced Division, teams can opt into the Advanced division! Otherwise, teams will play in the Beginner division.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q:** What is a CTF?  
**A:** CTF is an acronym for "capture-the-flag," which in the context of the cybersecurity field are competitions where teams solve security-related challenges to find a flag (usually a string of text). The flag can then be submitted to the competition platform for points, and the teams compete against each other for the most points!

**Q:** How are tie-breakers determined?  
**A:** The leaderboard is sorted first by the team with the most points. If teams have the same number of points, then the team who submitted their most recent flag earlier wins the tie-break.

**Q:** How do I form a team?  
**A:** By the day before the competition, we will be opening team registration on our competition platform. Feel free to find your team partner beforehand. We will also have multiple opportunities before and during the event to find and form teams!

**Q:** I heard that there will be companies present. Do I need to dress up or prepare a resume?  
**A:** We do not require a dress code and the expectation is that most people will be dressed casually. We will be offering a resume book to our sponsors and a resume PDF upload form will be provided during the event. If you need help preparing a resume, feel free to ask for advice in our Discord or take advantage of campus career resources!
