## Rules
1. No sharing flags or solutions.

3. No sabotaging other teams.
4. Teams are limited to two players each.
5. Unless specified otherwise, the flag format is `sigpwny{*}`.

## Divisions
The competition is divided into a Beginner and Advanced division to fairly distribute prizes. There are no differences in challenges or challenge difficulty between divisionsâ€”all challenges are designed to be approached by beginners. 

If one team member meets the requirements for the Advanced division, the entire team must compete under the Advanced division.

### Beginner Division
The beginner division is intended for underclassmen students who do not have much experience with CTFs, cybersecurity, or even computer science! We require teams with experience to compete in the Advanced division instead.

### Advanced Division
If either you or your teammate have taken CS 341 (previously CS 241), ECE 391, or have played in three or more CTFs, then your team should be registered in the Advanced division. If you have some experience or would like to compete in the Advanced Division, teams can opt into the Advanced division! Otherwise, teams will play in the Beginner division.
