## Meeting Summary
- Reverse engineering is the process of understanding a program's functionality and behavior
- Symbolic analysis tools such as `angr` help determine what codepath is desired and how to reach that point
- Self-modifying code exists as additional protections against reverse engineering
- Side channel attacks, such as instruction counting, can be used to leak information or determine the current state of a program
- Virtual machine obfuscation is a technique used to make reverse engineering more difficult by creating another layer of execution
