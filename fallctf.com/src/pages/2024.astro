        <details>
          <summary>What is a "capture the flag" (CTF) competition?</summary>
          <div>CTFs are cybersecurity competitions where teams solve hacking challenges to find a "flag," usually a formatted string. Flags can then be submitted to the competition platform for points. The more flags you capture, the more points you get!</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if I'm new to cybersecurity?</summary>
          <div>Fall CTF is designed for you! Specifically, Fall CTF is meant to be a fun learning experience for beginners rather than an intense competition. We provide guides for each challenge category which will teach you as you play. Additionally, we have a large number of staff to help you in-person if you feel stuck.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Are there any practice challenges? How can I prepare?</summary>
          <div>You can find beginner-friendly challenges similar to Fall CTF on <Link href="https://ctf.sigpwny.com/">Pwny CTF</Link>, which is SIGPwny's 24/7 internal CTF that runs alongside <Link href="https://sigpwny.com/meetings/">club meetings</Link>.</div>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I work with others?</summary>
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <span>Fall CTF can only be played in teams of up to two. We keep team sizes small so that you have more opportunities to solve challenges! We also ask that teams do not share flags or solutions with each other. If you feel stuck, reach out to a staff member.</span>
            <span>On the day before the competition, we will be open team registration on our competition platform. Feel free to find a partner beforehand; otherwise, there will be plenty of opportunities before and during the event to find and form teams!</span>

        <details>
          <summary>Help! How do I contact a staff member?</summary>
          <div>Join our <Link href="https://sigpwny.com/discord">Discord</Link> to be able to ask your question online. We have a ticketing system that you can use to privately message the Fall CTF team. Additionally, you can ask anyone in-person wearing a badge with a green lanyard for help.</div>

          <summary>How do tiebreaks work?</summary>
          <div>The leaderboard is first sorted by points. If any teams have the same number of points, then the team who submitted their latest flag earlier wins the tiebreak.</div>

          <summary>I heard that companies will be attending. Do I need a resume?</summary>
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <span>We will be offering a resume upload form as one of the challenges during the event. Uploaded resumes will be provided to our sponsors as a resume book. If you need help preparing a resume, feel free to ask for advice in our <Link href="https://sigpwny.com/discord">Discord</Link> or take advantage of campus career resources!</span>
            <span>Some of our sponsors will be attending in-person and will be available to talk to during the event.</span>

          <div>Currently, Fall CTF registration is limited to UIUC students. If you are not from UIUC and wish to participate, please email <a href="mailto:hello@sigpwny.com">hello@sigpwny.com</a> for a manual review.</div>
