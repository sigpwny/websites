## Summary

Learn about more advanced cryptography techniques! Topics include the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman encryption, and RSA encryption.

Elliptic curve cryptography is similar to a game of billiards: given a billiard table with an arrangement of billiard balls, determine the precise shot that was made to put the balls in that arrangement.
