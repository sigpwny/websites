title: Binary Exploitation Help Session
week_number: 8
---
Since everyone's been pretty busy lately with midterms we are going to take it a bit slower this week - today's meeting is a "study hall," where you'll have the opportunity to chill and work on problems from the password cracking and binary exploitation meetings with our help. We'll also solve a few challenges on-screen to help you with the stack material.
