## Meeting Summary
- Reverse engineering is the process of understanding a program's functionality and behavior
- Disassemblers are programs that translate machine code into assembly language
- Debuggers like `gdb` can be used to detect errors in computer programs
- `binutils` are programming tools for managing binary programs
- Hardware reversing is the process of physically taking apart an engineered product
